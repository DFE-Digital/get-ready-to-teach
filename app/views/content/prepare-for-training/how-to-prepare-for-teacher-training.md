## Get classroom experience
Getting classroom experience can be a good way to help you feel more familiar with the school environment before you start your placement. Many providers recommend it.

You could arrange a few days in person with a school near you or explore life in the classroom virtually on TeachQuest.

You do not have to have classroom experience before you start training, but it could help you feel better prepared.

## Find out about funding
There are lots of different ways to fund your teacher training.

Depending on the subject you’re training to teach, you could be eligible for a scholarship or bursary.

You may also be entitled to extra support if you:

- are a parent or carer
- have a learning difficulty, health condition or disability
- are a veteran

## Talk to your provider about any reasonable adjustments
Teacher training providers can make adjustments if you need support to become a teacher. This includes support for:

- neurodiversity
- long term physical health conditions
- mental health conditions
- accessibility needs

It’s best to talk to your provider about this as soon as possible to make sure you have all the support in place you need.

## Talk to your training provider
Your training provider may have already been in touch and started your induction. Do not worry if not – many providers will wait until September.

You might want to think about any questions you have about your training to ask during your induction. For example, key milestones and assessments throughout the year and what support might be available.
